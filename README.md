# Face-Recognition
Face recognition is performed using  a siamese neural network optimizing the triplet loss function
The pretrained model we use is inspired by Victor Sy Wangâ€™s implementation and was loaded using his code: https://github.com/iwantooxxoox/Keras-OpenFace.
Our implementation also took a lot of inspiration from the official FaceNet github repository: https://github.com/davidsandberg/facenet
